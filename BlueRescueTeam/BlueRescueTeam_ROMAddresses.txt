overlay_1__02143d40 -> overlay_1__0214406c

This seems to be some sort of initialiser. The function get's called from two sources, one of which is overlay_1__0214406c.
The purpose of overlay_1__0214406c is only to call overlay_1__02143d10.

overlay_1__0214406c get's called all over the place, but I want to focus on it's calling from overlay_1__02143d10.

We're going to call overlay_1__02143d40 'arm9 caller', due to it's numerous calls to functions in arm9.bin
We're going to call overlay_1__0214406c 'the mono', due to it's singular purpose
We're going to call overlay_1__02143d10 'the loop'.

'the loop' is one of the most referenced functions in the whole of the Dungeon Engine, at 430.
It's only purpose is to repeatedly call 'the mono', taking one int argument to determine how many iterations are done. I've seen a lot of 10's but it's not exclusively that amount.
When looking at the functions that the 'arm9 caller' calls, it's interesting to note that those functions are also called by functions in the arm9.bin proper, as well as
  overlay_0 and overlay_1. All the function calls 'arm9 caller' makes has at least one other overlay also call it. Most have all three.
This tells me that whatever's being done in these calls is pretty low level and probably not implicitly noticable in gameplay. Not to mention that they're probably being called 10
  times in a row in one go.
