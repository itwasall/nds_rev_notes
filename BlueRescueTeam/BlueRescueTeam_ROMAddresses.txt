'the mono', 'the loop' and the 'arm9 caller'

overlay_1__02143d40 -> overlay_1__0214406c

This seems to be some sort of initialiser. The function get's called from two sources, one of which is overlay_1__0214406c.
The purpose of overlay_1__0214406c is only to call overlay_1__02143d10.

overlay_1__0214406c get's called all over the place, but I want to focus on it's calling from overlay_1__02143d10.

We're going to call overlay_1__02143d40 'arm9 caller', due to it's numerous calls to functions in arm9.bin
We're going to call overlay_1__0214406c 'the mono', due to it's singular purpose
We're going to call overlay_1__02143d10 'the loop'.

'the loop' is one of the most referenced functions in the whole of the Dungeon Engine, at 430.
It's only purpose is to repeatedly call 'the mono', taking one int argument to determine how many iterations are done. I've seen a lot of 10's but it's not exclusively that amount.
When looking at the functions that the 'arm9 caller' calls, it's interesting to note that those functions are also called by functions in the arm9.bin proper, as well as
  overlay_0 and overlay_1. All the function calls 'arm9 caller' makes has at least one other overlay also call it. Most have all three.
This tells me that whatever's being done in these calls is pretty low level and probably not implicitly noticable in gameplay. Not to mention that they're probably being called 10
  times in a row in one go. 

The overlay_2 equivilent to 'arm9 caller' look very similar. It's not just that functions in overlay_2 are calling the same stuff as 'arm9 caller'. Literally *a* single function is
  calling the same stuff.
overlay_0 has another similar looking function to 'arm9 caller'. There are minor differences between all three, but it seems they are roughly doing the same thing. Despite being from
  different overlays.
In fact upon further inspection, it seems as those there is at least one function in arm9.bin that is also doing all this shit. Talk about mission critical stuff.

Target functions are:
  0x0200178c -> returns
  0x02002048 -> DAT_020ed4c0
  0x02008a00 (with some bullshit as args) -> DAT_020f7d8c
  0x02007200 -> Does a lot
  0x02001fb0 -> DAT_020ed4c0, DAT_020ec504, some bizarre shit with a DAT_0700000??
  0x02001e14 -> DAT_020ecd40, DAT_020e9fc4, some other func calls
  0x02000e9c -> DAT_020ec100
  0x02009be0 -> bunch of stuff
  func_0x01ff86b8 (idk either)
  0x020084d4 -> a lot of talking to the i/o registers. too many data regs to list here
  0x020187c0  _DAT_0213420c _DAT_02134214 _DAT_02134210
