When opening the job list:
	address 0x020eb988 contains a pointer to 0x0213c940
	changing this pointer to be random garbage corrupts the job menu in hilarious ways


JOB LIST SHIT

Upon opening 'Job List' menu in any capacity (mail box, bulletin board, char menu):
0x020EAE74: 0x0211EE60
0x020EAE78: 0x02113404
0x020EAE88: 
	If job list open: 0x021132E4
	If bul boar open: 0x021134D8
		(This remains true for the same job)
0x0211338F: Changing value from 00 to not 00 simulates an 'A' button press on currently selected job

0x0211341C: Pointer to current job info

JOB INFO STRUCT:

Apparently which dungeon a job is from changes its description. There might be some bizzare
checksumming involved that calculates which response to give. 

offset 0x00 - Dungeon ID - Also changes first line of desc
offset 0x01 - Floor ID - Also changes second line of desc
offset 0x08-0x09 - Client pokedex number
offset 0x0a-0x0b - target pokedex number (for jobs like 'please return my friend!', where the pokemon listing the job isn't the pokemon that will appear in the dungeon related to the job)
offset 0x0c - reward 1 ID
offset 0x0d - reward 2 ID (when jobs have a "100 poke + ?" reward, this is the '?')
offset 0x0e - Also reward related i guess I DONT GET IT
