Ability "------" is a placeholder with no effect or in-game description

BASE EXP FORMULA
============

Exp. Points = int((D+A)*C)
D = int(A x (B - 1) / 10)
where:
A       Enemy Pokemon's base experience value
B       Enemy Pokemon's Level
C       0.5 if only hit with regular attacks
C       1.0 if it was hit with a move and recieved at least 1HP of damage
C       1.5 if it was hit with a linked move and recieved at least 1HP of damage


EVOLUTION
============

Evolution Type:
  0x00    Nothing
  0x01    Level Requirement
  0x02    IQ Requirement
  0x03    Item requirement
  0x13    Always zero

Evolution Requirement:
  for Type 0x01     Value of level required
  for Type 0x02     Value of IQ required
  for Type 0x03     ID of item required
  
  IQ requirements are stand-ins for evolution via high happiness in the core series

Additional Evolution Requirements:

  0x04    Need link cable (0x76)
  0x05    Attack > Defense
  0x06    Attack < Defense 
  0x07    Attack = Defense 
  0x08    Need sun ribbon (0x30)
  0x09    Need lunar ribbon (0x31)
  0x10    Need beauty scarf (0x2F)
  0x11    Probability 50% - Heads
  0x12    Probability 50% - Tails

additional reqs 0x05, 0x06 & 0x07 I believe are for Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan & Hitmontop
The probabilities I believe are for pokemon like Wurmple, who's evolution is chance based.
